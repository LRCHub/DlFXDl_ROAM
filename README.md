[00:03.54] Ooh
[00:05.04] 
[00:09.18] I, I just woke up from a dream
[00:15.80] Where you and I had to say goodbye
[00:20.38] And I don't know what it all means
[00:24.98] But since I survived, I realized
[00:40.98] 
[00:29.55] Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
[00:34.24] Nobody's promised tomorrow
[00:38.69] So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
[00:42.64] Like it's the last night
[00:54.64] 
[00:44.91] If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
[00:54.09] If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
[01:03.15] I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
[01:12.22] If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
[01:36.72] 
[01:21.02] Ooh
[01:22.52] 
[01:25.14] Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
[01:33.48] I don't even wanna do this anymore
[01:37.94] 'Cause you already know what you mean to me
[01:41.38] And our love's the only war worth fighting for
[02:04.38] 
[01:46.94] Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
[01:51.74] Nobody's promised tomorrow
[01:56.19] So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
[02:00.19] Like it's the last night
[02:12.19] 
[02:02.45] If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
[02:11.54] If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
[02:20.61] I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
[02:29.73] If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
[02:54.23] 
[02:38.56] Right next to you
[02:43.05] Next to you
[02:47.65] Right next to you
[02:51.30] Oh-oh, oh
[02:55.80] 
[03:10.76] If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
[03:19.80] If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
[03:29.09] I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
[03:38.16] If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
[03:47.28] If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
[04:11.78] 
[03:55.87] Ooh
[03:59.32] I'd wanna be next to you
